  ## Installation
  To use this generator, you will need to install node.js and inquirer@8.2.4. To install necessary dependencies in node, run the following command: 
  npm i

  ## Usage
  After installation, user can run node index.js in the terminal. This will provide the user with a series of prompts for user input. Prompts will ask questions about the user's project such as github username, email, project name, project description, license type, what commands are needed to install and test, usage and contribution information. A user can type in their input for each question and hit enter, which will take them to the next question. After the last prompt, the user will see a "success" message in the console and a README.md file will be generated using their input inside of the README.md template.
